# The classic Minesweeper game written in Vanilla Javascript

This is one of my first projects I made for learning purposes, originally developed in 2017 (I was kinda amateur back then so dont judge! 😛 ). It is a simple minesweeper game, where the full game graphics (HTML Buttons 😀) are rendered dynamically! You can play the game or see the code to have a look of how it is made! Maybe this will help some one that is currently a begginer! If you have some comments or questions feel free to reach me, I would be very glad to discuss with you!
